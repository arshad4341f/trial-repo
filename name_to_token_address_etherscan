To retrieve an ERC20 token contract address using its token name through the Etherscan API, you need to use the "tokens" module and the "search" action, providing the token symbol as a parameter in your API request; this will return the contract address associated with the searched token name. 

 Key points:  

    • API endpoint: https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=stats&action=tokensupply&contractaddress=<contract_address>&apikey=<your_api_key>  
    • Required parameter: symbol (the token symbol you want to search for) 

 Example request: 
    https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=stats&action=tokensymbol&symbol=ETH&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY


Explanation: 

• module=stats: Specifies that you are querying data related to token statistics. 
• action=tokensymbol: Indicates that you want to search for a token based on its symbol. 
• symbol=ETH: The token symbol you are searching for (replace with the desired token symbol) 
• apikey=YOUR_API_KEY: Your Etherscan API key, necessary to make API requests 

Important considerations:   

• API key: You need to obtain an Etherscan API key to use the API.  
• Token verification: Always double-check the returned contract address to ensure it matches the intended token. 
• Error handling: Implement proper error handling in your code to manage cases where the token is not found or the API request fails.

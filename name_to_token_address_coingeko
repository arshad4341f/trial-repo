To retrieve an ERC20 token contract address using its name through the CoinGecko API, you need to use the /coins/list endpoint with the include_platform=true parameter, which will return a list of coins including their platform details, allowing you to access the contract address if available for the desired token based on its name; you can then search for the specific token by its name in the response data to find its contract address. 

Key steps: 

• API endpoint: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list?include_platform=true   

• How to use: 
	• Make an API call to the above endpoint.  
	• In the response, iterate through the list of coins and find the one with the token name you are looking for.  
	• Once you find the matching token, access the "contract" field in the response data to retrieve the contract address. 



Important points to consider: 

• Not all tokens have contract addresses: Some tokens on CoinGecko might not have a listed contract address.  
• Token ID might be needed: If you want to access more detailed information about a specific token, you may need to use its CoinGecko ID in another API call to get the contract address.  

Example code snippet (using Python with the requests library): 
import requests



def get_token_contract_address(token_name):

    url = f"https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list?include_platform=true"

    response = requests.get(url)

    data = response.json()



    for coin in data:

        if coin["name"] == token_name:

            return coin["contract"]  



    return None  # Token not found



# Usage

token_name = "Uniswap"

contract_address = get_token_contract_address(token_name)

print(contract_address)
